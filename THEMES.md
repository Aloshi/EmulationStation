Themes
======

EmulationStation allows each system to have its own "theme." A theme is a collection **views** that define some **elements**, each with their own **properties**.

The first place ES will check for a theme is in the system's `<path>` folder, for a theme.xml file:
* `[SYSTEM_PATH]/theme.xml`

If that file doesn't exist, ES will try to find the theme in the current **theme set**.  Theme sets are just a collection of individual system themes arranged in the "themes" folder under some name.  A theme set can provide a default theme that will be used if there is no matching system theme.  Here's an example:

```
...
   themes/
      my_theme_set/
         snes/
            theme.xml
            my_cool_background.jpg

         nes/
            theme.xml
            my_other_super_cool_background.jpg

         common_resources/
            scroll_sound.wav

         theme.xml (Default theme)
      another_theme_set/
         snes/
            theme.xml
            some_resource.svg
```

The theme set system makes it easy for users to try different themes and allows distributions to include multiple theme options.  Users can change the currently active theme set in the "UI Settings" menu.  The option is only visible if at least one theme set exists.

There are two places ES can load theme sets from:
* `[HOME]/.emulationstation/themes/[CURRENT_THEME_SET]/[SYSTEM_THEME]/theme.xml`
* `/etc/emulationstation/themes/[CURRENT_THEME_SET]/[SYSTEM_THEME]/theme.xml`

`[SYSTEM_THEME]` is the `<theme>` tag for the system, as defined in `es_systems.cfg`.  If the `<theme>` tag is not set, ES will use the system's `<name>`.

If both files happen to exist, ES will pick the first one (the one located in the home directory).

Again, the `[CURRENT_THEME_SET]` value is set in the "UI Settings" menu.  If it has not been set yet or the previously selected theme set is missing, the first available theme set will be used as the default.

Simple Example
==============

Here is a very simple theme that changes the description text's color:

```xml
<theme>
	<formatVersion>3</formatVersion>
	<view name="detailed">
		<text name="description">
			<color>00FF00</color>
		</text>
		<image name="my_image" extra="true">
			<pos>0.5 0.5</pos>
			<origin>0.5 0.5</origin>
			<size>0.8 0.8</size>
			<path>./my_art/my_awesome_image.jpg</path>
		</image>
	</view>
</theme>
```

How it works
============

Everything must be inside a `<theme>` tag.

**The `<formatVersion>` tag *must* be specified**.  This is the version of the theming system the theme was designed for.  The current version is 3.



A *view* can be thought of as a particular "screen" within EmulationStation.  Views are defined like this:

```xml
<view name="ViewNameHere">
	... define elements here ...
</view>
```



An *element* is a particular visual element, such as an image or a piece of text.  You can either modify an element that already exists for a particular view (as is done in the "description" example), like this:

```xml
	<elementTypeHere name="ExistingElementNameHere">
		... define properties here ...
	</elementTypeHere>
```

Or, you can create your own elements by adding `extra="true"` (as is done in the "my_image" example) like this:

```xml
	<elementTypeHere name="YourUniqueElementNameHere" extra="true">
		... define properties here ...
	</elementTypeHere>
```

"Extra" elements will be drawn in the order they are defined (so define backgrounds first!).  When they get drawn relative to the pre-existing elements depends on the view.  Make sure "extra" element names do not clash with existing element names!  An easy way to protect against this is to just start all your extra element names with some prefix like "e_".



*Properties* control how a particular *element* looks - for example, its position, size, image path, etc.  The type of the property determines what kinds of values you can use.  You can read about the types below in the "Reference" section.  Properties are defined like this:

```xml
		<propertyNameHere>ValueHere</propertyNameHere>
```




Advanced Features
=================

It is recommended that if you are writing a theme you launch EmulationStation with the `--debug` and `--windowed` switches.  This way you can read error messages without having to check the log file.  You can also reload the current gamelist view and system view with `Ctrl-R` if `--debug` is specified.

### The `<include>` tag

You can include theme files within theme files, similar to `#include` in C (though the internal mechanism is different, the effect is the same).  Example:

`~/.emulationstation/all_themes.xml`:
```xml
<theme>
	<formatVersion>3</formatVersion>
	<view name="detailed">
		<text name="description">
			<fontPath>./all_themes/myfont.ttf</fontPath>
			<color>00FF00</color>
		</text>
	</view>
</theme>
```

`~/.emulationstation/snes/theme.xml`:
```xml
<theme>
	<formatVersion>3</formatVersion>
	<include>./../all_themes.xml</include>
	<view name="detailed">
		<text name="description">
			<color>FF0000</color>
		</text>
	</view>
</theme>
```

Is equivalent to this `snes/theme.xml`:
```xml
<theme>
	<formatVersion>3</formatVersion>
	<view name="detailed">
		<text name="description">
			<fontPath>./all_themes/myfont.ttf</fontPath>
			<color>FF0000</color>
		</text>
	</view>
</theme>
```

Notice that properties that were not specified got merged (`<fontPath>`) and the `snes/theme.xml` could overwrite the included files' values (`<color>`).  Also notice the included file still needed the `<formatVersion>` tag.



### Theming multiple views simultaneously

Sometimes you want to apply the same properties to the same elements across multiple views.  The `name` attribute actually works as a list (delimited by any characters of `\t\r\n ,` - that is, whitespace and commas).  So, for example, to easily apply the same header to the basic, grid, and system views:

```xml
<theme>
	<formatVersion>3</formatVersion>
	<view name="basic, grid, system">
		<image name="logo">
			<path>./snes_art/snes_header.png</path>
		</image>
	</view>
	<view name="detailed">
		<image name="logo">
			<path>./snes_art/snes_header_detailed.png</path>
		</image>
	</view>
</theme>
```

This is equivalent to:
```xml
<theme>
	<formatVersion>3</formatVersion>
	<view name="basic">
		<image name="logo">
			<path>./snes_art/snes_header.png</path>
		</image>
	</view>
	<view name="detailed">
		<image name="logo">
			<path>./snes_art/snes_header_detailed.png</path>
		</image>
	</view>
	<view name="grid">
		<image name="logo">
			<path>./snes_art/snes_header.png</path>
		</image>
	</view>
	<view name="system">
		<image name="logo">
			<path>./snes_art/snes_header.png</path>
		</image>
	</view>
	... and any other view that might try to look up "logo" ...
</theme>
```



### Theming multiple elements simultaneously

You can theme multiple elements *of the same type* simultaneously.  The `name` attribute actually works as a list (delimited by any characters of `\t\r\n ,` - that is, whitespace and commas), just like it does for views, as long as the elements have the same type.  This is useful if you want to, say, apply the same color to all the metadata labels:

```xml
<theme>
    <formatVersion>3</formatVersion>
    <view name="detailed">
    	<!-- Weird spaces/newline on purpose! -->
    	<text name="md_lbl_rating, md_lbl_releasedate, md_lbl_developer, md_lbl_publisher, 
    	md_lbl_genre,    md_lbl_players,        md_lbl_lastplayed, md_lbl_playcount">
        	<color>48474D</color>
        </text>
    </view>
</theme>
```

Which is equivalent to:
```xml
<theme>
    <formatVersion>3</formatVersion>
    <view name="detailed">
    	<text name="md_lbl_rating">
    		<color>48474D</color>
    	</text>
    	<text name="md_lbl_releasedate">
    		<color>48474D</color>
    	</text>
    	<text name="md_lbl_developer">
    		<color>48474D</color>
    	</text>
    	<text name="md_lbl_publisher">
    		<color>48474D</color>
    	</text>
    	<text name="md_lbl_genre">
    		<color>48474D</color>
    	</text>
    	<text name="md_lbl_players">
    		<color>48474D</color>
    	</text>
    	<text name="md_lbl_lastplayed">
    		<color>48474D</color>
    	</text>
    	<text name="md_lbl_playcount">
    		<color>48474D</color>
    	</text>
    </view>
</theme>
```

Just remember, *this only works if the elements have the same type!*

### Element rendering order with z-index

You can now change the order in which elements are rendered by setting `zIndex` values.  Default values correspond to the default rendering order while allowing elements to easily be shifted without having to set `zIndex` values for every element.  Elements will be rendered in order from smallest z-index to largest.

#### Defaults

##### system
* Extra Elements `extra="true"` - 10
* `carousel name="systemcarousel"` - 40
* `text name="systemInfo"` - 50

##### basic, detailed, grid, video
* `image name="background"` - 0
* Extra Elements `extra="true"` - 10
* `textlist name="gamelist"` - 20
* `imagegrid name="gamegrid"` - 20
* Media
	* `image name="md_image"` - 30
	* `video name="md_video"` - 30

		* `text name="md_description"`
		* `text name="md_name"`
* System Logo/Text - 50
	* `text name="logoText"`
	* `image name="logo"`

### Theme variables

Theme variables can be used to simplify theme construction.  There are 2 types of variables available.
* System Variables
* Theme Defined Variables

#### System Variables

System variables are system specific and are derived from the values in es_systems.cfg.
* `system.name`
* `system.fullName`
* `system.theme`

#### Theme Defined Variables
Variables can also be defined in the theme.
```
<variables>
	<themeColor>8b0000</themeColor>
</variables>
```

#### Usage in themes
Variables can be used to specify the value of a theme property:
```
<color>${themeColor}</color>
```

or to specify only a portion of the value of a theme property:

```
<color>${themeColor}c0</color>
<path>./art/logo/${system.theme}.svg</path>
````

## Types of properties:

* NORMALIZED_PAIR - two decimals, in the range [0..1], delimited by a space.  For example, `0.25 0.5`.  Most commonly used for position (x and y coordinates) and size (width and height).
* PATH - a path.  If the first character is a `~`, it will be expanded into the environment variable for the home path (`$HOME` for Linux or `%HOMEPATH%` for Windows).  If the first character is a `.`, it will be expanded to the theme file's directory, allowing you to specify resources relative to the theme file, like so: `./../general_art/myfont.ttf`.
* BOOLEAN - `true`/`1` or `false`/`0`.
* COLOR - a hexidecimal RGB or RGBA color (6 or 8 digits).  If 6 digits, will assume the alpha channel is `FF` (not transparent).
* FLOAT - a decimal.
* STRING - a string of text.


## Types of elements and their properties:

Common to almost all elements is a `pos` and `size` property of the NORMALIZED_PAIR type.  They are normalized in terms of their "parent" object's size; 99% of the time, this is just the size of the screen.  In this case, `<pos>0 0</pos>` would correspond to the top left corner, and `<pos>1 1</pos>` the bottom right corner (a positive Y value points further down).  `pos` almost always refers to the top left corner of your element.  You *can* use numbers outside of the [0..1] range if you want to place an element partially or completely off-screen.

The order you define properties in does not matter.
Remember, you do *not* need to specify every property!
*Note that a view may choose to only make only certain properties on a particular element themable!*

#### image

Can be created as an extra.

* `pos` - type: NORMALIZED_PAIR.
* `size` - type: NORMALIZED_PAIR.
	- If only one axis is specified (and the other is zero), the other will be automatically calculated in accordance with the image's aspect ratio.
* `maxSize` - type: NORMALIZED_PAIR.
	- The image will be resized as large as possible so that it fits within this size and maintains its aspect ratio.  Use this instead of `size` when you don't know what kind of image you're using so it doesn't get grossly oversized on one axis (e.g. with a game's image metadata).
* `origin` - type: NORMALIZED_PAIR.
	- Where on the image `pos` refers to.  For example, an origin of `0.5 0.5` and a `pos` of `0.5 0.5` would place the image exactly in the middle of the screen.  If the "POSITION" and "SIZE" attributes are themable, "ORIGIN" is implied.
* `rotation` - type: FLOAT.
	- angle in degrees that the image should be rotated.  Positive values will rotate clockwise, negative values will rotate counterclockwise.
* `rotationOrigin` - type: NORMALIZED_PAIR.
	- Point around which the image will be rotated. Defaults to `0.5 0.5`.
* `path` - type: PATH.
	- Path to the image file.  Most common extensions are supported (including .jpg, .png, and unanimated .gif).
* `default` - type: PATH.
	- Path to default image file.  Default image will be displayed when selected game does not have an image.
* `tile` - type: BOOLEAN.
	- If true, the image will be tiled instead of stretched to fit its size.  Useful for backgrounds.
* `color` - type: COLOR.
	- Multiply each pixel's color by this color. For example, an all-white image with `<color>FF0000</color>` would become completely red.  You can also control the transparency of an image with `<color>FFFFFFAA</color>` - keeping all the pixels their normal color and only affecting the alpha channel.
* `zIndex` - type: FLOAT.
	- z-index value for component.  Components will be rendered in order of z-index value from low to high.

#### imagegrid

* `pos` - type: NORMALIZED_PAIR.
* `size` - type: NORMALIZED_PAIR.
    - The size of the grid. Take care the selected tile can go out of the grid size, so don't position the grid too close to another element or the screen border.
* `margin` - type: NORMALIZED_PAIR.
* `gameImage` - type: PATH.
    - The default image used for games which doesn't have an image.
* `folderImage` - type: PATH.
    - The default image used for folders which doesn't have an image.
* `scrollDirection` - type: STRING.
    - `vertical` by default, can also be set to `horizontal`. Not that in `horizontal` mod, the tiles are ordered from top to bottom, then from left to right.

#### gridtile

* `size` - type: NORMALIZED_PAIR.
    - The size of the default gridtile is used to calculate how many tiles can fit in the imagegrid. If not explicitly set, the size of the selected gridtile is equal the size of the default gridtile * 1.2
* `padding` - type: NORMALIZED_PAIR.
    - The padding around the gridtile content. Default `16 16`. If not explicitly set, the selected tile padding will be equal to the default tile padding.
* `imageColor` - type: COLOR.
    - The default tile image color and selected tile image color have no influence on each others.
* `backgroundImage` - type: PATH.
    - If not explicitly set, the selected tile background image will be the same as the default tile background image.
* `backgroundCornerSize` - type: NORMALIZED_PAIR.
    - The corner size of the ninepatch used for the tile background. Default is `16 16`.
* `backgroundColor` - type: COLOR.
    - A shortcut to define both the center color and edge color at the same time. The default tile background color and selected tile background color have no influence on each others.

* `maxSize` - type: NORMALIZED_PAIR.
	- The video will be resized as large as possible so that it fits within this size and maintains its aspect ratio.  Use this instead of `size` when you don't know what kind of video you're using so it doesn't get grossly oversized on one axis (e.g. with a game's video metadata).
* `origin` - type: NORMALIZED_PAIR.
	- Where on the image `pos` refers to.  For example, an origin of `0.5 0.5` and a `pos` of `0.5 0.5` would place the image exactly in the middle of the screen.  If the "POSITION" and "SIZE" attributes are themable, "ORIGIN" is implied.
* `rotation` - type: FLOAT.
	- angle in degrees that the text should be rotated.  Positive values will rotate clockwise, negative values will rotate counterclockwise.
* `rotationOrigin` - type: NORMALIZED_PAIR.

* `showSnapshotDelay` - type: BOOLEAN
	- If true, playing of video will be delayed for `delayed` seconds, when game is selected.
* `zIndex` - type: FLOAT.
	- z-index value for component.  Components will be rendered in order of z-index value from low to high.

#### text

Can be created as an extra.

* `pos` - type: NORMALIZED_PAIR.
* `size` - type: NORMALIZED_PAIR.
	- Possible combinations:
	- `0 0` - automatically size so text fits on one line (expanding horizontally).
	- `w 0` - automatically wrap text so it doesn't go beyond `w` (expanding vertically).
	- `w h` - works like a "text box."  If `h` is non-zero and `h` <= `fontSize` (implying it should be a single line of text), text that goes beyond `w` will be truncated with an elipses (...).
* `origin` - type: NORMALIZED_PAIR.
	- Where on the component `pos` refers to.  For example, an origin of `0.5 0.5` and a `pos` of `0.5 0.5` would place the component exactly in the middle of the screen.  If the "POSITION" and "SIZE" attributes are themable, "ORIGIN" is implied.
* `rotation` - type: FLOAT.
	- angle in degrees that the text should be rotated.  Positive values will rotate clockwise, negative values will rotate counterclockwise.

* `alignment` - type: STRING.
	- Valid values are "left", "center", or "right".  Controls alignment on the X axis.  "center" will also align vertically.
* `forceUppercase` - type: BOOLEAN.  Draw text in uppercase.
* `lineSpacing` - type: FLOAT.  Controls the space between lines (as a multiple of font height).  Default is 1.5.
* `zIndex` - type: FLOAT.
	- z-index value for component.  Components will be rendered in order of z-index value from low to high.

	- Secondary color; what this means depends on the text list.  For example, for game lists, it is the color of a folder.
* `fontPath` - type: PATH.
* `fontSize` - type: FLOAT.
* `scrollSound` - type: PATH.
	- Sound that is played when the list is scrolled.
* `alignment` - type: STRING.

EmulationStation borrows the concept of "nine patches" from Android (or "9-Slices"). Currently the implementation is very simple and hard-coded to only use 48x48px images (16x16px for each "patch"). Check the `data/resources` directory for some examples (button.png, frame.png).
* `zIndex` - type: FLOAT.
	- z-index value for component.  Components will be rendered in order of z-index value from low to high.

#### rating

* `pos` - type: NORMALIZED_PAIR.
* `size` - type: NORMALIZED_PAIR.
	- Only one value is actually used. The other value should be zero.  (e.g. specify width OR height, but not both.  This is done to maintain the aspect ratio.)
* `origin` - type: NORMALIZED_PAIR.
	- Where on the component `pos` refers to.  For example, an origin of `0.5 0.5` and a `pos` of `0.5 0.5` would place the component exactly in the middle of the screen.  If the "POSITION" and "SIZE" attributes are themable, "ORIGIN" is implied.
* `rotation` - type: FLOAT.
	- angle in degrees that the rating should be rotated.  Positive values will rotate clockwise, negative values will rotate counterclockwise.
